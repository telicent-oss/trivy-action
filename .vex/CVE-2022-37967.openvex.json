Additionally exploiting this vulnerability also requires a vulnerable samba package, which is not present in our images, or connecting to a vulnerable Active Directory service.  As this vulnerability with samba/Active Directory has been known for some time, were an adversary able to force Kerberos authentication to happen somehow, they would also need a vulnerable Active Directory server present in the environment."
